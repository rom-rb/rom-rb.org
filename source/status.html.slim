  | The ROM ecosystem consists of the core rom gem along with rom-rails,
    for Rails integration, and various adapter gems.

  | With so many projects, it can be difficult to keep up on the status of
    each one. Below is a break-down for each rom-related project, the current
    stable released version, and the build status for the master branch.
