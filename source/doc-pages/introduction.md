Ruby Object Mapper (ROM) is a Ruby persistence library with the goal to provide
powerful object mapping capabilities without limiting the full power of your
datastore.

More specifically, ROM exists to:

* Isolate the application from persistence details
* Provide minimum infrastructure for mapping and persistence
* Provide shared abstractions for lower-level components
* Provide simple use of the underlying datastore when desired
