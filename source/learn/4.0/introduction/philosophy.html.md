ROM leverages Ruby’s linguistic strengths with a blend of Object Oriented and
Functional styles. Following a powerful composition pattern, every ROM object
shares a common pipeline interface and returns data without side-effects. It’s
also built with dependency-injection in mind; there are no public class-level
interfaces beyond the setup interface.

All ROM components are stand-alone; they are loosely coupled, can be used
independently, and follow the single responsibility principle. A single object
that handles coercion, state, persistence, validation, and all-important
business logic rapidly becomes complex. Instead, ROM provides the infrastructure
that allows you to easily create small, dedicated classes for handling each
concern individually, and then tie them together in a developer-friendly way.

## ROM is not a typical Object-Relational-Mapper

ROM is based on several concepts and decisions that differentiate it from
commonplace Ruby ORMs. The fundamental flaw behind ORMs is the idea that it
could be easy to either:

1. Map objects to database tables one-to-one (the
   [ActiveRecord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern) design
   pattern); or
2. Introduce a complex machinery to translate between objects and persistence
   structures (the
   [DataMapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapper_pattern) pattern)

Both strategies are cumbersome. ActiveRecord writes you into a corner, limiting
your application’s modeling to what’s convenient for the database. ROM isn’t
bound one-to-one with database tables, and that enables developers to use the
best persistence tool for the task at hand.

DataMapper is one step better, but retains the complexity and ambiguity of
managing mutable objects. ROM bypasses that complexity by working statelessly.
